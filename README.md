## 🌍 Hi there! I’m Maral, a data enthusiast with a passion for sustainability and creativity!

Aside from work and studying, I’m passionate about quality education (particularly in rural areas), equal opportunity, and sustainable development. I’ve contributed to several projects that advance these causes and continue to explore ways to combine data and purpose to drive real-world impact.

📚 **Education**: Currently pursuing a Master’s in Management Analytics at McGill University, focusing on machine learning and enterprise data science.

🚀 **Career Highlights**: I bring three years of experience in sustainable finance, having led green banking initiatives, authored sustainability reports, and secured international climate funding through project proposals.

🌱 **Skills & Tools**: Proficient in Python, R, SQL, Power BI, and a range of machine learning techniques and cloud platforms.

🎨 **Interests**: When I’m not crunching numbers, you’ll find me refining my charcoal sketching, bouldering with friends, playing volleyballs, or brainstorming creative sustainability ideas.

📍 Based in Montréal, Canada\
